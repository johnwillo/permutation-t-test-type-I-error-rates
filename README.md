# Test of permutation t test type I error rates through simulation
This paper examines, through simulations, how well a two-sample permutation t test (also called a randomization t test) approximates the desired Type I error specified in the test. The permutation t test uses the same t statistic as the independent-sample t test, but obtains a p value from the permutation distribution of the t statistic, instead of using the theoretical distribution derived from the parametric assumption. Two advantages of this approach are: 1) it is likely to be more robust than the independent-sample t test in situations where the assumption of normality is violated, and 2) unlike a traditional permutation test, it can employ a Welch t test, which allows for variances to be unequal. A separate report shows that type I error rates for the traditional permutation test are not sufficiently robust when both sample sizes and variances differ.

The results for equal and unequal sample sizes and equal and unequal variances are examined, both for normal and skewed distributions.
